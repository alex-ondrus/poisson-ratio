# Poisson Ratio

Many of the observations that we make can be modelled as Poisson distributed random variables. If the underlying process we are observing has completely changed from one observation to the next, it may be appropriate to assume that the observations are from two independent processes. Here I analyze the inference that we can make about the underlying average values of the two distributions, and the ratio of the two.
